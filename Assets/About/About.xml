	<description>Unite with others, together We Are United!

"We Are United" formerly "Family Reunion" - allows you to recruit pawns who is related to your colonist or has no home.

Usage:

Right-click on the pawn with selected colonist and 'Ask to unite'.
[Sometimes option doesn't appear, just try a few more times in a different parts of texture]

When you 'Ask to unite', selected colonist will try to recruit targeted pawn with some chance.

Chance of success is calculated considering:

1. Relation importance (Spouse is the most important relation in game, chance will be affected by 25%)
2. Opinion of target about colonist (Max opinion of 100, chance will be affected by 50%)
3. Social skill of colonist (Max skill level of 20, chance will be affected by 50%)

Idea:

When I was playing, parents of my colonist wander in with other faction, and only thing I could do - arrest them.
It's just sad to see when related pawns wander in and all you can do for reunion is arrest...

This mod is friendly solution for reunion, faction will not consider reunion as a hostile act.
